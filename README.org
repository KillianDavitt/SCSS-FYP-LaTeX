* SCSS Latex-Org
This is a fork of Stephen Shaw's
[[https://github.com/stesh/SCSS-FYP-LaTeX]] with the purpose of adapting
it for easy use with Emacs org mode

** Requirements
- xelatex
- emacs
- org-mode

** Usage
- clone the repo :)
- add the fyp.el file to your emacs init file
- Change your personal info in constants.tex
- Edit your report in body.org 
- Export with C-c C-e
- *Make sure you set export body only with C-b*
- Then hit l l to export to a .tex file

Compile the report with the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
xetex report.tex
bibtex report
xetex report.tex
#+END_SRC

** Font issues
By default Helvetica is used for the title page, Helvetica is hard to
get on any kind of linux, i'd recommend changing the font to "Nimbus
Sans L" if you can't get Helvetica installed. I'd imagine it would work
fine on windows and possibly also on MacOS
